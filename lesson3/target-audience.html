    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The target audience is people that need or want to know how is the weather every day. Usually, adults are more
      interested in the weather information, so the site will focus on this audience. Also, we want to be a community
      site so we will share region information and because of this we will have some teenagers as a target audience that
      want to know about events or what to do in our region.
      Most users will use a smartphone to use the website and probably for looking for what will be the weather before
      a trip, the weekends events, the local store that sell what the user wants, the local news, and how will be the
      the weather during the next week.
